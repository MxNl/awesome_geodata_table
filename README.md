# What is it good for?

The **Awesome Geodata Table** is a searchable collection of geo data
sets. If you are searching for spatial data sets for your research
project, you can enter search terms or use the column filters to scan
through the underlying data collection. But be aware that it just
provides a collection of meta data and information on where to download
the data. It does not provide the data itself. Its initial purpose was
to collect data sets that could be used as environmental predictors or
features in machine learning applications.

# How to use the table?

Just open the [**Awesome Geodata
Table**](https://mxnl.github.io/awesome_geodata_table/) and search for
data sets or use the column filters to narrow your search. <br><br>
