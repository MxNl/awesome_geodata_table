# What is it good for?

The **Awesome Geodata Table** is a searchable collection of geo data sets. If you are searching for spatial data sets for your research project, you can enter search terms or use the column filters to scan through the underlying data collection. But be aware that it just provides a collection of meta data and information on where to download the data. It does not provide the data itself. Its initial purpose was to collect data sets that could be used as environmental predictors or features in machine learning applications.

# How to use the table?

Just open the [**Awesome Geodata Table**](https://mxnl.github.io/awesome_geodata_table/) and search for data sets or use the column filters to narrow your search.
